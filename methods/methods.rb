#Methods
upcase = capitalizes everything
downcase = lowercases everything
gets = gets response from the user
capitalize= capitalizes the first letter
include? = looks for a specific value and if found within the value it will return true else it will return false;
gsub! = replace a value with a new value
split(",") = splits a string based off the parameter, and will return an array


#loops
while loop = will loop thru as long as the condition is true
Until loop = will loop thru as long as the condition is false
For loop = will loop as long as the condition is true (.. will go to the highest value, ... will stop the second highest value)

#Iterator loops
loop do = ????
times do = similar to for loop, but very compact
Each do (Array) =Used to loops thru an array, {} can be deleted with the word do (i.e. array.each do |x|)

#unless is used to reverse if and else if statement
#use "end" when using else and else if
# ! in method are dangerous methods, meaning that it will mutate the original value if
# IF ! is not in an method, this means that it is safe method, it will not change the original value
# ?in a method is trying to say that it will show true or false value.
# gets also adds a blank line just like puts

###LOOPS AND ITERATION#####
#For loop uses 2 or 3 dots, 2 dots mean go to the highest number, 3 dots mean go to the number right before highest number
#Unlike Javascript incrementing or decrementing only works with += -= rather than ++ or --
#when to use loop do vs for loop

#Need to go over
