#If else statement
#if you use if statement always end it with an end statement


if 10<5
    print "this is true"
elsif 10==5
    print "this is NOT TRUE"
end

hungary = false;

unless hungary
    print "Gonna write code"
else
    print "Time to eat!"
end

#questions
##javascript is else if and ruby is elsif
##unless is a revese of if and elsif!
## does true overwrite false?!?!? look at combining boolean operators
